# Supply Chain Verification System

A comprehensive blockchain-based supply chain verification system built on Stacks that provides transparency, traceability, and authenticity verification for products from origin to consumer.

## üåü Overview

This smart contract system enables complete transparency in supply chains by tracking products through every stage of their journey. It supports multiple entity types, certification management, quality assurance checkpoints, and consumer verification - all recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Entities**: Supply chain participants (Producers, Manufacturers, Distributors, Retailers, Certification Authorities)
- **Products**: Items being tracked through the supply chain
- **Certificates**: Digital certifications for products and entities
- **Checkpoints**: Quality assurance and inspection points
- **Custody Transfers**: Ownership changes between entities
- **Consumer Verifications**: End-user authenticity checks

## üîß Features

### Entity Management
- **Multi-role Support**: Producers, Manufacturers, Distributors, Retailers, and Certification Authorities
- **Entity Registration**: Secure registration with authorization controls
- **Entity Verification**: Verification by contract owner or certification authorities
- **Sustainability Scoring**: Track sustainability metrics for each entity

### Product Tracking
- **Complete Lifecycle**: From origin certification to final sale
- **State Management**: Automatic state transitions based on custody transfers
- **URI Support**: Link to off-chain product data and documentation
- **Verification Status**: Track product authenticity and certification status

### Certification System
- **Multiple Certificate Types**: Organic, Fair Trade, Sustainably Sourced, Non-GMO, Carbon Neutral
- **Flexible Certification**: Certify both products and entities
- **Certificate Management**: Issue, revoke, and track certificate validity
- **Authority Control**: Only certified authorities can issue certificates

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Quality, sustainability, and ethical metrics (0-100 scale)
- **Checkpoint Recording**: Document inspections with evidence URIs
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of checkpoint authenticity
- **Location Tracking**: Geographic data for each checkpoint

### Consumer Features
- **Product Verification**: Consumers can verify product authenticity
- **Feedback System**: Rating and feedback collection (1-5 scale)
- **Journey Transparency**: View complete product history and certifications
- **Multiple Verification Methods**: Support for various verification approaches

5. **At Distributor** (u5) - At distribution center
6. **At Retailer** (u6) - At retail location
7. **Sold** (u7) - Final consumer purchase

### Certification Types

2. **Fair Trade** (u2) - Fair trade compliance
3. **Sustainably Sourced** (u3) - Sustainable sourcing
4. **Non-GMO** (u4) - Non-genetically modified
5. **Carbon Neutral** (u5) - Carbon neutrality certification

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd supply-chain-verification-onStacks
```

2. Install Clarinet (if not already installed):
```bash
# macOS
brew install clarinet

# Other platforms - see Clarinet documentation
```

## üìù Usage Examples

### Register an Entity
```clarity
;; Register a new producer
(contract-call? .stacks-supply-verification register-entity 
  u"Organic Farm Inc" 
  u1  ;; Producer type
  u"California, USA" 
  u"contact@organicfarm.com"
  'SP1ABC123...)  ;; Principal address
```

### Register a Product
```clarity
;; Register a new product (must be called by verified entity)
(contract-call? .stacks-supply-verification register-product
  u"Organic Tomatoes"
  u"Fresh organic tomatoes grown without pesticides"
  u"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmABC123...")
```

### Issue a Certificate
```clarity
;; Issue organic certificate (must be called by certification authority)
(contract-call? .stacks-supply-verification issue-certificate
  u1  ;; Organic certification
  none  ;; No specific recipient entity
  (some u1)  ;; For product ID 1
  u1000000  ;; Valid until block 1000000
  u"https://certifications.org/organic/123")
```

### Transfer Custody
```clarity
;; Transfer product to distributor
(contract-call? .stacks-supply-verification transfer-custody
  u1  ;; Product ID
  u3  ;; To entity ID 3 (distributor)
  u"Transferred after quality inspection"
  0x1234...)  ;; Verification signature
```

  u88  ;; Sustainability score
  u92  ;; Ethical score
  u"All quality standards met"
  u"https://evidence.com/qc/123"
